It is a popular coding language to to many factors such as its readability. But this well-know programming language had to start from somewhere, In the late 1980s, Guido van Rossum first conceived the idea of Python. He created Python and was the sole individual responsible for implementing Python at his workspace. However, he took a “permanent vacation” from being Python's “benevolent dictator for life”. This title was what he was called in the Python community.<br/><br/>Over the years, Python has developed a lot. It started in 1991 as version 0.9.0 and has progressed to version 3.12.1 which was released on December 7th, 2023</div>
